 Piped city gas supply in India is not yet developed on major scale,energy
 Biomass is a renewable energy source and its use for energy generation is carbon-neutral fuel,energy
 It is carbon neutral because it would also release global warming green house gasses like methane and carbon dioxide when it is left to degenerate without using as energy source,energy
" Presently, only 20% of house holds in India use biomass and charcoal for cooking purpose as LPG use for cooking purpose is rising rapidly",energy
" In addition biomass is also used marginally in commercial cooking, electricity generation, process industries, etc",energy
 The total biomass use in India is nearly 177 Mtoe in the year 2013,energy
 Substantial surplus crop residue is also burnt in agriculture fields for clearing the land for the next crop,energy
 Nearly 750 million tons of non edible (by cattle) biomass is available annually in India which can be put to use for higher value addition,energy
 Huge quantity of imported coal is being used in pulverised coal-fired power stations,energy
 Raw biomass is not suitable for use in the pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking problem,energy
 However 100% biomass can be fired after Torrefaction in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal,energy
 Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source,energy
 Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem,energy
 North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems,energy
" As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution",energy
" Biogas which is mainly methane/natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle, poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print",energy
 The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil from algae particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future,energy
 Union government is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential,energy
"India was the third largest electricity producer in the world 1272 TWh in FY 2014–15, though only about 80% of the population had access to mains power",energy
" By 2013, India became the world's third largest producer of electricity with 4",energy
"8% global share, surpassing Japan and Russia",energy
India ranks 7th globally in hydropower generation during the year 2015,energy
 India has 111 gigawatts (GW) (32%) installed capacity of renewable energy,energy
 It is one of the world leaders in renewable energy investments and installations,energy
 India has set a set a target of 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022,energy
" This would include 100 GW capacity from solar energy sources, 60 GW from wind power, 10 GW from biopower, and 5 GW from small hydropower",energy
 A bidding process for a further 115 GW (excluding large hydropower) is expected by the end of FY 2019-20 to achieve 175 GW total installed capacity and in early 2018 the central government set up a US$350-million fund to finance solar projects,energy
 India is the 7th largest producer of hydroelectric power in the world,energy
" As of 30 April 2017, India's installed utility-scale hydroelectric capacity was 44,594 MW, or 13",energy
5% of its total utility power generation capacity,energy
" Additional smaller hydroelectric power units with a total capacity of 4,380 MW (1",energy
3% of its total utility power generation capacity) have been installed,energy
" India's hydroelectric power potential is estimated at 148,700 MW at 60% load factor",energy
" In the fiscal year 2016-17, the total hydroelectric power generated in India was 122",energy
31 TWh (excluding small hydro) with an average capacity factor of 33%,energy
" The hydro-electric power plants at Darjeeling and Shivanasamudram were established in 1898 and 1902, respectively",energy
 They were among the first in Asia and India has been a dominant player in global hydroelectric power development,energy
 India also imports surplus hydroelectric power from Bhutan,energy
"Small hydropower, defined to be generated at facilities with nameplate capacities up to 25 MW, comes under the ambit of the Ministry of New and Renewable energy (MNRE); whilst large hydro, defined as above 25 MW, comes under the ambit of Ministry of Power",energy
" ndia's economically exploitable and viable hydroelectric potential is estimated to be 148,701 MW",energy
" An additional 6,780 MW from smaller hydro schemes (with capacities of less than 25 MW) is estimated as exploitable",energy
" 56 sites for pumped storage schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of 94,000 MW have also been identified",energy
" In central India, the hydroelectric power potential from the Godavari, Mahanadi, Nagavali, Vamsadhara and Narmada river basins has not been developed on a major scale due to potential opposition from the tribal population",energy
The public sector accounts for 92,energy
5% of India's hydroelectric power production,energy
" The National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), Northeast Electric Power Company (NEEPCO), Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVNL), THDC, and NTPC-Hydro are some of the public sector companies producing hydroelectric power in India",energy
 The private sector is also expected to grow with the development of hydroelectric energy in the Himalayan mountain ranges and in the northeast of India,energy
" Indian companies have also constructed hydropower projects in Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and other countries",energy
"Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), a state-owned enterprise in north India, has an installed capacity of 2",energy
 BBMB is a major source of peaking power and black start capability to the northern grid in India and its large reservoirs provide wide operational flexibility,energy
 BBMB reservoirs also supply water for the irrigation of 12,energy
"5 million acres (51,000 km2; 19,500 sq mi) of agricultural land in partner states, enabling the green revolution in the northern India",energy
"The International Hydropower Association estimates that the total hydropower potential in India is 660,000 TWh/year, of which 540,000 TWh/year (79%) is still undeveloped",energy
" India ranks as the fourth country in the world by undeveloped hydropower potential, after Russia, China and Canada, and fifth by total potential, surpassed also by Brazil",energy
 India has transformed from an electricity deficit state to an electricity surplus state,energy
 Peak load shortages can be met making use of pumped storage schemes which store surplus power to meet peak load demands,energy
" The pumped storage schemes also contribute secondary, seasonal power at no additional cost when rivers are flooded with excess water",energy
" India has already established nearly 4,800 MW pumped storage capacity with the installation of hydropower plants",energy
" Pumped storage units can also be used as pumping stations to supply river water for upland irrigation, industrial needs, and drinking water",energy
" In a tropical country like India, abundant watefor agriculture is needed due to a very high annual evaporation rate",energy
 The amount of water necessary to meet this demand can be harnessed from India's rivers via pumped storage units,energy
 Food security in India is improved with water security which in turn is possible from the energy security to supply the power needed for the pumped storage schemes,energy
More and more solar power generation is becoming available at cheaper cost and it has advantage in terms of environmental impact,energy
 Solar power can meet daytime and night time energy demands with the help of pumped storage units,energy
" Many of the existing hydro power stations on the west-flowing rivers located in the Western Ghats of Kerala and Karnataka are to be expanded to include pumped storage units in an effort to solve the water deficit of east-flowing rivers like the Kaveri, the Krishna, etc",energy
 Wind power generation capacity in India has significantly increased in recent years,energy
 As of 31 March 2019 the total installed wind power capacity was 36,energy
"625 GW, the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world",energy
" Wind power capacity is mainly spread across the South, West, North and East regions",energy
 Wind power costs in India are decreasing rapidly,energy
 The levelised tariff of wind power reached a record low of 243,energy
" In December 2017, union government announced the applicable guidelines for tariff-based wind power auctions to bring more clarity and minimise the risk to the developers",energy
" Development of wind power in India began in December 1952, when Maneklal Sankalchand Thacker, a distinguished power engineer, initiated a project with the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to explore the possibilities of harnessing wind power in the country",energy
 The CSIR established a Wind Power Sub-Committee under P,energy
" Nilakantan, which was assigned the task of investigating the available resources that could be practically utilized, along with researching the economic possibilities of wind energy",energy
" With assistance from the Indian Meteorological Department, the Sub-Committee extensively reviewed available data on surface winds in India and their velocity duration, and began detailed surveys of promising sites for harnessing the optimum amount of wind energy; it also successfully developed and tested large wood-and-bamboo windmills",energy
 Golding's recommendations were adopted by the CSIR in 1957,energy
" By this time, regions of Saurashtra and around Coimbatore had been identified as promising sites for generating electricity from wind power, and the Wind Power Sub-Committee had begun to erect 20 wind velocity survey stations across India, in addition to testing its indigenously designed windmills and obtaining a 6 kw",energy
" Allgaier wind turbine, which was presented to India by the West German government; experiments at Porbandar with the latter had commenced by 1961",energy
" The Indian government also considered a proposal to erect over 20,000 small to medium-sized wind-powered electrical generators in rural districts, to be used for powering water pumps and supplying electricity for remotely situated structures such as lighthouses",energy
" In 1960, the CSIR established a Wind Power Division as part of the new National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL) in Bangalore, which was founded that year",energy
" From the 1960s into the 1980s, the NAL and other groups continued to carry out wind velocity surveys and develop improved estimates of India's wind energy capacity",energy
" Large-scale development of wind power began in 1985 with the first wind project in Veraval, Gujarat, in the form of a 40-kW Dutch machine (make Polenko) connected to the grid",energy
" In 1986, demonstration wind farms were set up in the coastal areas of Maharashtra (Ratnagiri), Gujarat (Okha) and Tamil Nadu (Tirunelveli) with 55 kW Vestas wind turbines",energy
 These demonstration projects were supported by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE),energy
" Jami Hossain of TERI University, New Delhi",energy
" This was subsequently re-validated by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, US (LBNL) in an independent study in 2012",energy
" As a result, the MNRE set up a committee to reassess the potential and through the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE, previously C-WET) has announced a revised estimation of the potential wind resource in India from 49,130 MW to 302,000 MW assessed at 100 m hub height",energy
 Wind turbines are now being set up at even 120 m hub height and the wind resource at higher hub heights of around 120 m or more that are prevailing is possibly even more,energy
" In 2015, the MNRE set the target for Wind Power generation capacity by the year 2022 at 60,000 MW",energy
 East and North east regions have no grid connected wind power plant as of December 2017,energy
 No offshore wind farm is under implementation as of December 2017,energy
" However, an Offshore Wind Policy was announced in 2015 and presently weather stations and LIDARs are being set up by NIWE at some locations",energy
 The first offshore wind farm is planned near Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadu,energy
" India started planning in 2010 to enter into offshore wind power,[36] and a 100 MW demonstration plant located off the Gujarat coast began planning in 2014",energy
" In 2013, a consortium (instead of group of organizations), led by Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) started project FOWIND (Facilitating Offshore Wind in India) to identify potential zones for development of off-shore wind power in India and to stimulate R & D activities in this area",energy
" The other consortium partners include the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), DNV GL, the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) and the World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE)",energy
 The consortium was awarded the grant of €4,energy
0 million by the delegation of the European Union to India in 2013 besides co-funding support from GPCL,energy
 The project action will be implemented from December 2013 to March 2018,energy
 The project focuses on the States of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for identification of potential zones for development through techno-commercial analysis and preliminary resource assessment,energy
" It will also establish a platform for structural collaboration and knowledge sharing between stakeholders from European Union and India, on offshore wind technology, policy, regulation, industry and human resource development",energy
 FOWIND activities will also help facilitate a platform to stimulate offshore wind related R&D activities in the country,energy
 The consortium published initial pre-feasibility assessment reports for offshore wind farm development in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu on 16 June 2015,energy
"In September 2015, the India's cabinet has approved the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy",energy
" With this, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been authorized as the Nodal Ministry for use of offshore areas within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)[41] India seems pacing up rapidly towards offshore wind energy development as the Nodal Ministry (MNRE) & Nodal Agency (NIWE) calls with the Expression of Interest (EoI) [42] inviting the bidders for development of first 1000MW commercial scale offshore windfarm in India, near the coast of Gujarat",energy
" The EoI published on 16th Apr 2018, specifies the proposed area identified under the FOWIND & FOWPI study funded by European Union",energy
" The proposed location of the offshore windfarm could be 23-40km off the coast from the Pipavav port, Gulf of Khambhat",energy
 The proposed area covers about 400sq km,energy
 The wind measurements & other data collection are under progress under the supervision of NIWE,energy
 Solar power in India is a fast developing industry,energy
 The country's solar installed capacity reached 29,energy
55 GW as of 30 June 2019,energy
 India has the lowest capital cost per MW globally to install the solar power plants,energy
" The Indian government had an initial target of 20 GW capacity for 2022, which was achieved four years ahead of schedule",energy
" In 2015 the target was raised to 100 GW of solar capacity (including 40 GW from rooftop solar) by 2022, targeting an investment of US$100 billion",energy
" India expanded its solar-generation capacity 8 times from 2,650 MW on 26 May 2014 to over 20 GW as on 31 January 2018",energy
" The country added 3 GW of solar capacity in 2015-2016, 5 GW in 2016-2017 and over 10 GW in 2017-2018, with the average current price of solar electricity dropping to 18% below the average price of its coal-fired counterpart",energy
 Rooftop solar power accounts for 3,energy
"4 GW, of which 70% is industrial or commercial",energy
" In addition to its large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) initiative, India is developing off-grid solar power for local energy needs",energy
" Solar products have increasingly helped to meet rural needs; by the end of 2015 just under one million solar lanterns were sold in the country, reducing the need for kerosene",energy
" That year, 118,700 solar home lighting systems were installed and 46,655 solar street lighting installations were provided under a national program; just over 1",energy
4 million solar cookers were distributed in India,energy
" With about 300 clear and sunny days in a year, the calculated solar energy incidence on India's land area is about 5000 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year (or 5 EWh/yr)",energy
 The solar energy available in a single year exceeds the possible energy output of all of the fossil fuel energy reserves in India,energy
 The daily average solar-power-plant generation capacity in India is 0,energy
"20 kWh per m2 of used land area, equivalent to 1400–1800 peak (rated) capacity operating hours in a year with available, commercially-proven technology",energy
"In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President François Hollande laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in Gwal Pahari, Gurgaon",energy
 The ISA will focus on promoting and developing solar energy and solar products for countries lying wholly or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn,energy
 The alliance of over 120 countries was announced at the Paris COP21 climate summit,energy
" One hope of the ISA is that wider deployment will reduce production and development costs, facilitating the increased deployment of solar technologies to poor and remote regions",energy
"In August 2016, the forecast for solar photovoltaic installations was about 4",energy
The country's solar capacity reached 19,energy
"7 GW by the end of 2017, making it the third-largest global solar market",energy
 The installed capacity of commercial solar thermal power plants (non storage type) in India is 227,energy
 Solar thermal plants with thermal storage are emerging as cheaper (US 7,energy
"15/KWh) and clean load following power plants to supply electricity round the clock,[91][92] working as dispatchable generation",energy
 Solar panels can be located in the space between the towers of wind-power plants,energy
This auxiliary power requirement can be made available from cheaper solar PV plant by envisaging hybrid solar plant with a mix of solar thermal and solar PV plants at a site,energy
" Generating hot water or air or steam using concentrated solar reflectors, is increasing rapidly",energy
Cogeneration of steam and power round the clock is also feasible with solar thermal CHP plants with storage capacity,energy
 The lack of an electricity infrastructure is a hurdle to rural India's development,energy
" India's power grid is under-developed, with large groups of people still living off the grid",energy
"In 2004, about 80,000 of the nation's villages still did not have electricity, 18,000 out of them could not be electrified by extending the conventional grid due to in-convenice",energy
" A target of electrifying 5,000 such villages was set for the 2002–2007 Five-Year Plan",energy
"It could bypass (or relieve) expensive, long-distance, centralized power-delivery systems, bringing inexpensive electricity to large groups of people",energy
India has sold or distributed about 1,energy
2 million solar home-lighting systems and 3,energy
"2 million solar lanterns, and has been ranked the top Asian market for solar off-grid products",energy
"By 2012, a total of 4,600,000 solar lanterns and 861,654 solar-powered home lights were installed",energy
" Typically replacing kerosene lamps, they can be purchased for the cost of a few months' worth of kerosene with a small loan",energy
" The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is offering a 30- to 40-percent subsidy of the cost of lanterns, home lights and small systems (up to 210 Wp)",energy
Twenty million solar lamps are expected by 2022 ,energy
 Lamps and lighting ,energy
 Solar photovoltaic water-pumping systems are used for irrigation and drinking water,energy
"Most pumps are fitted with a 200–3,000 W (0",energy
"02 hp) motor powered with a 1,800 Wp PV array which can deliver about 140,000 litres (37,000 US gal) of water per day from a total hydraulic head of 10 m (33 ft)",energy
" By 30 September 2006 a total of 7,068 solar photovoltaic water pumping systems were installed,[113] and 7,771 were installed by March 2012",energy
" During hot sunny daytime when the water needs are more for watering the fields, solar pumps performance can be improved by maintaining pumped water flowing/sliding over the solar panels to keep them cooler and clean",energy
 Solar driers are used to dry harvests for storage,energy
" Low cost solar powered bicycles are also available to ply between fields and village for agricultural activity, etc",energy
" In India, large areas are being covered by solar PV panels every year",energy
" Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rainwater falling on them and drinking or breweries water quality, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple filtration and disinfection processes, as rainwater is very low in salinity",energy
"Good quality water resources, closer to populated areas, are becoming a scarcity and increasingly costly for consumers",energy
 Exploitation of rainwater for value-added products like bottled drinking water makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall and cloudy areas by the increased income from drinking water generation ,energy
" Nuclear power is the fifth-largest source of electricity in India after coal, gas, hydroelectricity and wind power",energy
" As of March 2018, India has 22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, having a total installed capacity of 6,780 MW",energy
 Nuclear power produced a total of 35 TWh and supplied 3,energy
" 7 more reactors are under construction with a combined generation capacity of 4,300 MW",energy
"In October 2010, India drew up a plan to reach a nuclear power capacity of 63 GW in 2032, but after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan people around proposed Indian nuclear power plant sites have launched protests, raising questions about atomic energy as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels",energy
" There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9,900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the Russian-backed 2,000 MW Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu",energy
" The state government of West Bengal, has also refused permission to a proposed 6,000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors",energy
 A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear programme at the Supreme Court,energy
 Nuclear power in India has suffered from generally low capacity factors,energy
" As of 2017, the lifetime weighted energy availability factor of the Indian fleet is 63",energy
 The availability factor of Indian reactors was 69,energy
 One of the main reasons for the low capacity factors is lack of nuclear fuel,energy
"As early as 1901, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) had recognised India as potentially having significant deposits of radioactive ores, including pitchblende, uranium and thorianite",energy
" In the ensuing 50 years, however, little to no effort was made to exploit those resources",energy
" During the 1920s and 1930s, Indian scientists maintained close links to their counterparts in Europe and the United States, and were well aware of the latest developments in physics",energy
" Krishnan, conducted pioneering research in nuclear physics in Europe during the 1930s",energy
" By 1939, Meghnad Saha, the Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta, had recognised the significance of the discovery of nuclear fission, and had begun to conduct various experiments in his laboratory related to nuclear physics",energy
" In the same year, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust sanctioned funds for installing a cyclotron at the University of Calcutta, but various difficulties likely related to the war delayed the project",energy
" He requested funds to establish a research institute of fundamental physics, ""with special reference to cosmic rays and nuclear physics",energy
" The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) was inaugurated in Mumbai the following year. s of 2009, India envisages to increase the contribution of nuclear power to overall electricity generation capacity from 2.8% to 9% within 25 years.[100] By 2020, India's installed nuclear power generation capacity was expected to increase to 20 GW.[101]. But the 2020 capacity will not exceed 7 GW, as the 2018 operating capacity is 6.2 GW, and only one more reactor is expected on line before 2020. As of 2018, India stands 13th in the world in terms nuclear capacity. Indigenous atomic reactors include TAPS-3, and -4, both of which are 540 MW reactors.",energy

Labour in India refers to employment in the economy of India,labour
" In 2012, there were around 487 million workers in India, the second largest after China",labour
"Of these over 94 percent work in unincorporated, unorganised enterprises ranging from pushcart vendors to home-based diamond and gem polishing operations",labour
" The organised sector includes workers employed by the government, state-owned enterprises and private sector enterprises",labour
"5 million workers, of which 3 million worked for government or government owned entities",labour
 A majority of labour in India is employed by unorganised sector (unincorporated),labour
 These include family owned shops and street vendors,labour
 Above is a self-employed child labourer in the unorganised retail sector of India,labour
 Labour at an unorganised handicraft manufacturing enterprise,labour
" Flooring work at a Portico in Hyderabad, India ",labour
Over 94 percent of India's working population is part of the unorganised sector,labour
"In local terms, organised sector or formal sector in India refers to licensed organisations, that is, those who are registered and pay GST",labour
" These include the publicly traded companies, incorporated or formally registered entities, corporations, factories, shopping malls, hotels, and large businesses",labour
" Unorganised sector, also known as own account enterprises, refers to all unlicensed, self-employed or unregistered economic activity such as owner manned general stores, handicrafts and handloom workers, rural traders, farmers, etc",labour
"India's Ministry of Labour, in its 2008 report, classified the unorganised labour in India into four groups",labour
"This classification categorized India's unorganised labour force by occupation, nature of employment, specially distressed categories and service categories",labour
" The unorganised occupational groups include small and marginal farmers, landless agricultural labourers, sharecroppers, fishermen, those engaged in animal husbandry, beedi rolling, labeling and packing, building and construction workers, leather workers, weavers, artisans, salt workers, workers in brick kilns and stone quarries, workers in saw mills, and workers in oil mills",labour
" A separate category based on nature of employment includes attached agricultural labourers, bonded labourers, migrant workers, contract and casual labourers",labour
" Another separate category dedicated to distressed unorganised sector includes toddy tappers, scavengers, carriers of head loads, drivers of animal driven vehicles, loaders and unloaders",labour
" The last unorganised labour category includes service workers such as midwives, domestic workers, barbers, vegetable and fruit vendors, newspaper vendors, pavement vendors, hand cart operators, and the unorganised retail",labour
The unorganised sector has low productivity and offers lower wages,labour
" Even though it accounted for over 94 percent of workers, India's unorganised sector created just 57 percent of India's national domestic product in 2006, or about 9 fold less per worker than the organised sector",labour
" According to Bhalla, the productivity gap sharply worsens when rural unorganised sector is compared to urban unorganised sector, with gross value added productivity gap spiking an additional 2 to 4 fold depending on occupation",labour
 Some of lowest income jobs are in the rural unorganised sectors,labour
 Poverty rates are reported to be significantly higher in families where all working age members have only worked the unorganised sector throughout their lives,labour
" Agriculture, dairy, horticulture and related occupations alone employ 52 percent of labour in India",labour
" About 30 million workers are migrant workers, most in agriculture, and local stable employment is unavailable for them",labour
" India's National Sample Survey Office in its 67th report found that unorganised manufacturing, unorganised trading/retail and unorganised services employed about 10 percent each of all workers nationwide, as of 2010",labour
 It also reported that India had about 58 million unincorporated non-Agriculture enterprises in 2010,labour
" In the organised private sector with more than 10 employees per company, the biggest employers in 2008 were manufacturing at 5 million; social services at 2",labour
"2 million, which includes private schools and hospitals; finance at 1",labour
"1 million which includes bank, insurance and real estate; and agriculture at 1 million",labour
" India had more central and state government employees in 2008, than employees in all private sector companies combined",labour
" If state-owned companies and municipal government employees were included, India had a 1",labour
8:1 ratio between public sector employees and private sector employees,labour
" In terms of gender equality in employment, male to female ratio was 5:1 in government and government owned enterprises; private sector fared better at 3:1 ratio",labour
" Combined, counting only companies with more than 10 employees per company, the organised public and private sector employed 5",labour
"Given its natural rate of population growth and aging characteristics, India is adding about 13 million new workers every year to its labour pool",labour
" India's economy has been adding about 8 million new jobs every year predominantly in low paying, unorganised sector",labour
"The remaining 5 million youth joining the ranks of poorly paid partial employment, casual labour pool for temporary infrastructure and real estate construction jobs, or in many cases, being unemployed",labour
 About 7 per cent of the 400 million-strong workforce were employed in the formal sector (comprising government and corporates) in 2000[14] contributing 60 per cent of the nominal GDP of the nation,labour
 The Trade Unions Act 1926 provided recognition and protection for a nascent Indian labour union movement,labour
" The number of unions grew considerably after independence, but most unions are small and usually active in only one firm",labour
" In 1997, India had about 59,000 trade unions registered with the government of India",labour
" Of these only 9,900 unions filed income and expenditure reports and claimed to represent 7",labour
" The state of Kerala at 9,800 trade unions had the highest number of registered unions, but only few filed income and expenditure reports with the government of India",labour
 The state of Karnataka had the fastest growth in number of unions between the 1950s to 1990s,labour
" In 1995, India had 10 central federations of trade unions, namely (arranged by number of member unions in 1980): INTUC, CITU, BMS, AITUC, HMS, NLO, UTUC, AIUTUC, NFITU and TUCC",labour
" Each federation had numerous local trade union affiliates, with the smallest TUCC with 65 and INTUC with 1604 affiliated unions",labour
" By 1989, BMS had become India's largest federation of unions with 3,117 affiliated unions, while INTUC remained the largest federation by combined number of members at 2",labour
" The largest federation of trade unions, INTUC, represents about 0",labour
5% of India's labour force in organised sector and unorganised sector,labour
" In 2010, over 98% of Indian workers did not belong to any trade unions and were not covered by any collective bargaining agreements",labour
"Economists have studied the industrial relations climate in India, with a large number of studies focusing on state-level differences in India's Industrial Disputes Act",labour
Some studies purport to show that pro-worker amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act have had a negative impact on industrial output and employment - as well as on poverty,labour
" However these studies have faced serious criticism on the grounds that the data used are misinterpreted, and that the results are not robust with respect to standard econometric tests",labour
"Between 1950 and 1970, labour disputes nearly tripled in India, from an average of 1000 labour disputes per year, to an average of 3000 labour disputes per year",labour
" The number of labour relations issues within a year peaked in 1973 at 3,370 labour disputes",labour
" The number of workers who joined labour disputes within the same year, and stopped work, peaked in 1979, at 2",labour
 The number of lost man-days from labour relation issues peaked in 1982 at 74,labour
7% of total man-days in organised sector,labour
" While the 1970s experienced a spike in labour unions and disputes, a sudden reduction in labour disputes was observed during 1975–1977, when Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, declared an emergency and amongst other things suspended many civil rights including the worker's right to strike",labour
This is a table showing trend of organised Labour Force,labour
" Union membership is concentrated in the organised sector, and in the early 1990s total membership was about 9 million",labour
" Many unions are affiliated with regional or national federations, the most important of which are the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the All India Trade Union Congress, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, and the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh",labour
" Politicians have often been union leaders, and some analysts believe that strikes and other labour protests are called primarily to further the interests of political parties rather than to promote the interests of the work force",labour
" The government recorded 1,825 strikes and lockouts in 1990",labour
3 million workers were involved in these labour disputes,labour
 The number and seriousness of strikes and lockouts have varied from year to year,labour
" However, the figures for 1990 and preliminary data from 1991 indicate declines from levels reached in the 1980s, when between 33 and 75 million workdays per year were lost because of labour disputes",labour
" In 1999, the government of India recorded about 927 strikes and lockouts, or about half of those for 1990",labour
" The number of lost man-days were about the same for 1999 and 1991, even though Indian economic output and number of workers had grown significantly over the 1990s",labour
" Between 2004 and 2011, India has experienced a decline in unionised labour",labour
" The number of labour disputes has dropped to 400 annually over the same period, compared with over 1,000 in the 1990s",labour
" The annual number of man-days lost to labour disputes in early 1990s averaged around 27 million; by 2010, while Indian economy has grown significantly and Indian labour force has expanded, the average number of man-days lost has dropped by about 30%",labour
 The downward trend continues both in terms of number of disputes and lost man-days per dispute,labour
" For example, India experienced 249 disputes in the first 5 months of 2010, and 101 disputes in 2012 over the same period",labour
" India's Ministry of Labour has identified significant issues with migrant, home or bondage labourers and child labour",labour
 Migrant skilled and unskilled labourers of India constitute about 40 to 85 percent of low wage working population in many parts of the Middle East,labour
" They are credited to having built many of the notable buildings in the Arab countries, including the Burj Khalifa in Dubai (above)",labour
 Various claims of poor living conditions and labour abuse have been reported ,labour
" India has two broad groups of migrant labourers - one that migrates to temporarily work overseas, and another that migrates domestically on a seasonal and work available basis",labour
 About 4 million Indian-origin labourers are migrant workers in the middle east alone,labour
" They are credited to have been the majority of workers who built many of Dubai, Bahrain, Qatar and Persian Gulf modern architecture, including the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in world's history which opened in January 2010",labour
" These migrant workers are attracted by better salaries (typically US$2 to 5 per hour), possibility of earning overtime pay, and opportunity to remit funds to support their families in India",labour
 The Middle East-based migrant workers from India remitted about US$20 billion in 2009,labour
" Once the projects are over, they are required to return at their own expenses, with no unemployment or social security benefits",labour
" In some cases, labour abuses such as unpaid salaries, unsafe work conditions and poor living conditions have been claimed",labour
"2 million - (Domestic workers, not domestic migrant workers)",labour
" These workers range from full-time to part-time workers, temporary or permanent workers",labour
" They are typically employed for remuneration in cash or kind, in any household through any agency or directly, to do the household work, but do not include any member of the family of an employer",labour
" Some of these work exclusively for a single employer, while others work for more than one employer",labour
" Some are live-in workers, while some are seasonal",labour
" The employment of these migrant workers is typically at the will of the employer and the worker, and compensation varies",labour
" Debt bondage Further information: Debt bondage in India Bonded labour is a forced relationship between an employer and n employee, where the compulsion is derived from outstanding debt",labour
" Often the interest accrues at a rate that is so high that the bonded labour lasts a very long periods of time, or indefinitely",labour
" Sometimes, the employee has no options for employment in the organised or unorganised sectors of India, and prefers the security of any employment including one offered in bonded labour form",labour
" While illegal, bonded labour relationships may be reinforced by force, or they may continue from custom",labour
" Once an employee enters into a bonded relationships, they are characterised by asymmetry of information, opportunity, no time to search for alternative jobs and high exit costs",labour
"Estimates of bonded labour in India vary widely, depending on survey methods, assumptions and sources",labour
 Official Indian government estimates claim a few hundred thousand labourers are bonded labourers; while a 1978 estimate placed bonded labour in India to be 2,labour
" The 32nd National Sample Survey Organisation survey in India estimated 343,000 bonded labourers in 16 major states, of which 285,379 were located and freed by 1996",labour
" The major employment sectors for debt bonded labour include: agriculture, stone quarries, brick kilns, religious and temple workmen, pottery, rural weaving, fishing, forestry, betel and bidi workers, carpet, illegal mining and fireworks",labour
 Child labour has been found in family debt bonded situations,labour
" In each survey, debt bonded labourers have been found in unorganised, unincorporated sector",labour
" India enacted Bonded Labour System Abolition Act (1976) to prohibit any and all forms of bonded labour practice, to protect the bonded labour, and to criminalize individuals and entities that hire, keep or seek bonded labour",labour
"6 million children, aged 5–14, who work either part-time or full-time",labour
" Of these over 60 percent work in unorganised agriculture sector, and the rest in other unorganised labour markets",labour
"Poverty, lack of schools, poor education infrastructure and growth of unorganised economy are considered as the most important causes of child labour in India",labour
 A 2009-2010 nationwide survey found child labour prevalence had reduced to 4,labour
98 million children (or less than 2% of children in 5-14 age group),labour
" Article 24 of India's constitution prohibits child labour, but only in factories, mines or hazardous employment",labour
" The Indian Penal Code, the Juvenile Justice (care and protection) of Children Act-2000, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Abolition) Act-1986 provide a basis in law to identify, prosecute and stop child labour in India",labour
" Nevertheless, child labour is observed in almost all unorganised, small scale, informal sectors of the Indian economy",labour
"Scholars suggest inflexibility and structure of India's labour market, size of informal economy, legal hurdles preventing industries from scaling up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors encouraging demand for and acceptability of child labour",labour
 The labour laws of India originated and express the socio-political views of leaders such as Nehru from pre-1947 independence movement struggle,labour
 These laws were expanded in part after debates in Constituent Assemblies and in part from international conventions and recommendations such as of International Labour Organization,labour
" The current mosaic of Indian laws on employment are thus a combination of India's history during its colonial heritage, India's experiments with socialism, important human rights and the conventions and standards that have emerged from the United Nations",labour
" The laws cover the right to work of one's choice, right against discrimination, prohibition of child labour, fair and humane conditions of work, social security, protection of wages, redress of grievances, right to organise and form trade unions, collective bargaining and participation in management",labour
" India has numerous labour laws such as those prohibiting discrimination and Child labour, those that aim to guarantee fair and humane conditions of work, those that provide social security, minimum wage, right to organise, form trade unions and enforce collective bargaining",labour
" India also has numerous rigid regulations such as maximum number of employees per company in certain sectors of economy, and limitations on employers on retrenchment and layoffs, requirement of paperwork, bureaucratic process and government approval for change in labour in companies even if these are because of economic conditions",labour
Indian labour laws are considered to be very highly regulated and rigid as compared to those of other countries in the world,labour
" The intensity of these laws have been criticised as the cause of low employment growth, large unorganised sectors, underground economy and low per capita income",labour
 These have led many to demand reforms for Labour market flexibility in India,labour
"India has over 50 major Acts and numerous laws that regulate employers in matters relating to industrial relations, employee unions as well as who, how and when enterprises can employ or terminate employment",labour
" Many of these laws survive from British colonial times, while some have been enacted after India's independence from Britain ",labour
 Labour is a subject in the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution and therefore labour matters are in the jurisdiction of both central and state governments,labour
 Both central and state governments have enacted laws on labour relations and employment issues,labour
 Some of the major laws relevant to India are:Workmen's Compensation Act of 1923 ,labour
The Workmen's Compensation Act compensates a workman for any injury suffered during the course of his employment or to his dependents in the case of his death,labour
 The Act provides for the rate at which compensation shall be paid to an employee,labour
 This is one of many social security laws in India,labour
Trade Unions Act of 1926 This Act enacted the rules and protections granted to Trade Unions in India,labour
 Payment of Wages Act of 1936 ,labour
 The Payment of Wages Act regulates by when wages shall be distributed to employees by the employers,labour
 The law also provides the tax withholdings the employer must deduct and pay to the central or state government before distributing the wages,labour
 Industrial Employment (Standing orders) Act of 1946 ,labour
 This Act requires employers in industrial establishments to define and post the conditions of employment by issuing so-called standing orders,labour
 These standing orders must be approved by the government and duly certified,labour
" These orders aim to remove flexibility from the employer in terms of job, hours, timing, leave grant, productivity measures and other matters",labour
" The standing orders mandate that the employer classify its employees, state the shifts, payment of wages, rules for vacation, rules for sick leave, holidays, rules for termination amongst others",labour
 Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 ,labour
"The Industrial Disputes act 1947 regulates how employers may address industrial disputes such as lockouts, layoffs, retrenchment etc",labour
" It controls the lawful processes for reconciliation, adjudication of labour disputes",labour
 The Act also regulates what rules and conditions employers must comply before the termination or layoff of a workman who has been in continuous service for more than one year with the employer,labour
" The employer is required to give notice of termination to the employee with a copy of the notice to appropriate government office seeking government's permission, explain valid reasons for termination, and wait for one month before the employment can be lawfully terminated",labour
 The employer may pay full compensation for one month in lieu of the notice,labour
" Furthermore, employer must pay an equivalent to 15 days average pay for each completed year of employees continuous service",labour
" Thus, an employee who has worked for 4 years in addition to various notices and due process, must be paid a minimum of the employee's wage equivalent to 60 days before retrenchment, if the government grants the employer a permission to lay off",labour
 Minimum Wages Act of 1948 ,labour
" The Minimum Wages Act prescribes minimum wages in all enterprises, and in some cases those working at home per the schedule of the Act",labour
 Central and State Governments can and do revise minimum wages at their discretion,labour
" The minimum wage is further classified by nature of work, location and numerous other factors at the discretion of the government",labour
 The minimum wage ranges between ? 143 to 1120 per day for work in the so-called central sphere,labour
 State governments have their own minimum wage schedules,labour
Industries (Regulation and Development) Act of 1951 ,labour
This law declared numerous key manufacturing industries under its so-called[dubious – discuss] First Schedule,labour
 It placed many industries under common central government regulations in addition to whatever laws state government enact,labour
" It also reserved over 600 products that can only be manufactured in small scale enterprises, thereby regulating who can enter in these businesses, and above all placing a limit on the number of employees per company for the listed products",labour
" The list included all key technology and industrial products in the early 1950s, including products ranging from certain iron and steel products, fuel derivatives, motors, certain machinery, machine tools, to ceramics and scientific equipment",labour
 Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952,labour
This Act seeks to ensure the financial security of the employees in an establishment by providing for a system of compulsory savings,labour
 The Act provides for establishments of a contributory Provident Fund in which employees' contribution shall be at least equal to the contribution payable by the employer,labour
 Minimum contribution by the employees shall be 10-12% of the wages,labour
 This amount is payable to the employee after retirement and could also be withdrawn partly for certain specified purposes,labour
The Maternity Benefit Act regulates the employment of the women and maternity benefits mandated by law,labour
" Any woman employee who worked in any establishment for a period of at least 80 days during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery, is entitled to receive maternity benefits under the Act",labour
" The employer is required to pay maternity benefits, medical allowance, maternity leave and nursing breaks",labour
 Payment of Bonus Act of 1965,labour
"This Act, applies to an enterprise employing 20 or more persons",labour
 The Act requires employer to pay a bonus to persons on the basis of profits or on the basis of production or productivity,labour
" The Act was modified to require companies to pay a minimum bonus, even if the employer suffers losses during the accounting year",labour
 Payment of Gratuity Act of 1972,labour
This law applies to all establishments employing 10 or more workers,labour
 Gratuity is payable to the employee if he or she resigns or retires,labour
 The Indian government mandates that this payment be at the rate of 15 days salary of the employee for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ? 1000000,labour
" It is an act to provide for a scheme for the payment of gratuity to employees engaged in factories, mines, oilfields, ports, plantations, shops or other establishments and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto",labour
"Scholars suggest India's rigid labour laws and excessive regulations assumed to protect the labour are the cause of slow employment growth in high paying, organised sector",labour
India's labour-related acts and regulations have led to labour-market rigidity,labour
" This encourages shadow economy for entrepreneurs, an economy that prefers to employ informal labour to avoid the complicated and opaque laws",labour
" In particular, Indian labour legislation such as the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 added rigid labour laws and one sided trade union laws",labour
" Although the Act does not prohibit layoffs and retrenchments, it does require entrepreneurs and companies to get the permission from government officials to fire an employee for absenteeism, retrench employees for economic reasons, or to close an economically nonviable company",labour
" This bureaucratic process can stretch into years, and the government officials have consistently and almost always denied such permission",labour
"As a result, the scholars argue that India's inflexible labour laws have created a strong disincentive to formally register new companies and hire additional workers in existing organised sector companies",labour
" Unlike China, Indian businesses have avoided substituting India's abundant labour for export or domestic opportunities, or use labour instead of expensive equipment for quality control or other operations",labour
 These are reasons for India's weak employment growth,labour
"More recently, a few scholars have completed a comparative study between states of India with different labour regulations",labour
" They compared states of India who have amended labour legislations to grant more flexibility to employers, to those states in India that have made their labour laws even more rigid and complicated to comply with",labour

"The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution from Articles 12 to 3 In this regard, the framers of the Constitution derived inspiration from the Constitution of USA ( Bill of Rights)",rights
 Part III of the Constitution is rightly described as the Magna Carta of India,rights
 It contains a very long and comprehensive list of ‘justiciable’ Fundamental Rights,rights
" In fact, the Fundamental Rights in our Constitution are more elaborate than those found in the Constitution of any other country in the world, including the USA",rights
 The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution to all persons without any discrimination,rights
" They uphold the equality of all individuals, the dignity of the individual, the larger public interest and unity of the nation",rights
 The Fundamental Rights are meant for promoting the ideal of political democracy,rights
" They prevent the establishment of an authoritarian and despotic rule in the country, and protect the liberties and freedoms of the people against the invasion by the State",rights
 They operate as limitations on the tyranny of the executive and arbitrary laws of the legislature,rights
" In short, they aim at establishing ‘a government of laws and not of men’",rights
" The Fundamental Rights are named so because they are guaranteed and protected by the Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the land",rights
" They are ‘fundamental’ also in the sense that they are most essential for the allround development (material, intellectual, moral and spiritual) of the individuals",rights
" Originally, the Constitution provided for seven Fundamental Rights viz,  Right to equality (Articles 14–18)  Right to freedom (Articles 19–22)  Right against exploitation (Articles 23–24)  Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25–28)  Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29–30)  Right to property (Article 31)  Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32) However, the right to property was deleted from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th Amendment Act, 197 It is made a legal right under Article 300-A in Part XII of the Constitution",rights
" So at present, there are only six Fundamental Rights",rights
" FEATURES OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS The Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution are characterised by the following:  Some of them are available only to the citizens while others are available to all persons whether citizens, foreigners or legal persons like corporations or companies",rights
" Thus, they strike a balance between the rights of the individual and those of the society as a whole, between individual liberty and social control",rights
"  Most of them are available against the arbitrary action of the State, with a few exceptions like those against the State’s action and against the action of private individuals",rights
" When the rights that are available against the State’s action only are violated by the private individuals, there are no constitutional remedies but only ordinary legal remedies",rights
"  They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for their enforcement, if and when they are violated",rights
  They are defended and guaranteed by the Supreme Court,rights
" Hence, the aggrieved person can directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal against the judgement of the high courts",rights
 The Parliament can curtail or repeal them but only by a constitutional amendment act and not by an ordinary act,rights
" Moreover, this can be done without affecting the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution",rights
"  They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 2 Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only when emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression ( external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion ( internal emergency)",rights
 (The suspension of fundamental rights during a national Emergency is explained in detail in Chapter 16),rights
"  Their scope of operation is limited by Article 31A (saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates, etc",rights
Article 31B (validation of certain acts and regulations included in the 9th Schedule) and Article 31C (saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles),rights
"  Their application to the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police forces, intelligence agencies and analogous services can be restricted or abrogated by the Parliament (Article 33)",rights
 Their application can be restricted while martial law is in force in any area,rights
 Martial law means ‘military rule’ imposed under abnormal circumstances to restore order (Article 34),rights
 It is different from the imposition of national emergency,rights
 Most of them are directly enforceable (self-executory) while a few of them can be enforced on the basis of a law made for giving effect to them,rights
 Such a law can be made only by the Parliament and not by state legislatures so that uniformity throughout the country is maintained (Article 35),rights
 DEFINITION OF STATE The term ‘State’ has been used in different provisions concerning the fundamental rights,rights
" Hence, Article 12 has defined the term for the purposes of Part III",rights
 It is the actions of these agencies that can be challenged in the courts as violating the Fundamental Rights,rights
" According to the Supreme Court, even a private body or an agency working as an instrument of the State falls within the meaning of the ‘State’ under Article 1 LAWS INCONSISTENT WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of any of the fundamental rights shall be void",rights
" In other words, it expressively provides for the doctrine of judicial review",rights
 This power has been conferred on the Supreme Court (Article 32) and the high courts (Article 226) that can declare a law unconstitutional and invalid on the ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights,rights
" The term ‘law’ in Article 13 has been given a wide connotation so as to include the following: (a) Permanent laws enacted by the Parliament or the state legislatures; (b) Temporary laws like ordinances issued by the president or the state governors; (c) Statutory instruments in the nature of delegated legislation (executive legislation) like order, bye-law, rule, regulation or notification; and (d) Non-legislative sources of law, that is, custom or usage having the force of law",rights
" Thus, not only a legislation but any of the above can be challenged in the courts as violating a Fundamental Right and hence, can be declared as void",rights
" Further, Article 13 declares that a constitutional amendment is not a law and hence cannot be challenged",rights
" However, the Supreme Court held in the Kesavananda Bharati case2 (1973) that a Constitutional amendment can be challenged on the ground that it violates a fundamental right that forms a part of the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution and hence, can be declared as void",rights
 Table 1 Fundamental Rights at a Glance Category Consists of  Right to equality (Articles 14– 18) (a) Equality before law and equal protection of laws (Article 14),rights

" Table 2 Fundamental Rights (FR) of Foreigners FR available only to citizens and not to foreigners FR available to both citizens and foreigners (except enemy aliens)  Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15)",rights
  Equality before law and equal protection of laws (Article 14),rights

  Protection in respect of conviction for offences (Article 20),rights
"  Protection of six rights regarding freedom of : (i) speech and expression, (ii) assembly, (iii) association, (iv) movement, (v) residence, and (vi) profession (Article 19)",rights

  Freedom to manage religious affairs (Article 26),rights
  Freedom from payment of taxes for promotion of any religion (Article 27),rights
Freedom from attending religious instruction or worship in certain educational institutions (Article 28),rights
 RIGHT TO EQUALITY  Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws Article 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India,rights
 This provision confers rights on all persons whether citizens or foreigners,rights
" Moreover, the word ‘person’ includes legal persons, viz, statutory corporations, companies, registered societies or any other type of legal person",rights
 The concept of ‘equality before law’ is of British origin while the concept of ‘equal protection of laws’ has been taken from the American Constitution,rights
" The second concept, on the other hand, connotes: (a) the equality of treatment under equal circumstances, both in the privileges conferred and liabilities imposed by the laws, (b) the similar application of the same laws to all persons who are similarly situated, and (c) the like should be treated alike without any discrimination",rights
" Thus, the former is a negative concept while the latter is a positive concept",rights
" However, both of them aim at establishing equality of legal status, opportunity and justice",rights
" The Supreme Court held that where equals and unequals are treated differently, Article 14 does not apply",rights
" While Article 14 forbids class legislation, it permits reasonable classification of persons, objects and transactions by the law",rights
" Rather, it should be based on an intelligible differential and substantial distinction",rights
" Rule of Law The concept of ‘equality before law’ is an element of the concept of ‘Rule of Law’, propounded by A",rights
" His concept has the following three elements or aspects: (i) Absence of arbitrary power, that is, no man can be punished except for a breach of law",rights
" (ii) Equality before the law, that is, equal subjection of all citizens (rich or poor, high or low, official or non-official) to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts (iii) The primacy of the rights of the individual, that is, the constitution is the result of the rights of the individual as defined and enforced by the courts of law rather than the constitution being the source of the individual rights",rights
 The first and the second elements are applicable to the Indian System and not the third one,rights
" In the Indian System, the constitution is the source of the individual rights",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the ‘Rule of Law’ as embodied in Article 14 is a ‘basic feature’ of the constitution,rights
 Exceptions to Equality The rule of equality before law is not absolute and there are constitutional and other exceptions to it,rights
"  Article 31-C is an exception to Article 1 It provides that the laws made by the state for implementing the Directive Principles contained in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 39 cannot be challenged on the ground that they are violative of Article 1 The Supreme Court held that “where Article 31-C comes in, Article 14 goes out”",rights
"  The foreign sovereigns (rulers), ambassadors and diplomats enjoy immunity from criminal and civil proceedings",rights
  The UNO and its agencies enjoy the diplomatic immunity,rights
"  Prohibition of Discrimination on Certain Grounds Article 15 provides that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth",rights
 The two crucial words in this provision are ‘discrimination’ and ‘only’,rights
 The word ‘discrimination’ means ‘to make an adverse distinction with regard to’ or ‘to distinguish unfavourably from others’,rights
 The use of the word ‘only’ connotes that discrimination on other grounds is not prohibited,rights
" The second provision of Article 15 says that no citizen shall be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth with regard to (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, road and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly by State funds or dedicated to the use of general public",rights
" This provision prohibits discrimination both by the State and private individuals, while the former provision prohibits discrimination only by the State",rights
 There are three exceptions to this general rule of non-discrimination: (a) The state is permitted to make any special provision for women and children,rights
" For example, reservation of seats for women in local bodies or provision of free education for children",rights
" (b) The state is permitted to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes For example, reservation of seats or fee concessions in public educational institutions",rights
" (c) The state is empowered to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes or the scheduled tribes regarding their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the state, except the minority educational institutions",rights
" The last provision was added by the 93rd Amendment Act of 200 In order to give effect to this provision, the Centre enacted the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, providing a quota of 27% for candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in all central higher educational institutions including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)",rights
" In April 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of both, the Amendment Act and the OBC Quota Act",rights
" But, the Court directed the central government to exclude the ‘creamy layer’ (advanced sections) among the OBCs while implementing the law",rights
" No citizen can be discriminated against or be ineligible for any employment or office under the State on grounds of only religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence",rights
 There are three exceptions to this general rule of equality of opportunity in public employment: (a) Parliament can prescribe residence as a condition for certain employment or appointment in a state or union territory or local authority or other authority,rights
" As the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act of 1957 expired in 1974, there is no such provision for any state except Andhra Pradesh5 and Telangana5a",rights
 (b) The State can provide for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class that is not adequately represented in the state services,rights
 (c) A law can provide that the incumbent of an office related to religious or denominational institution or a member of its governing body should belong to the particular religion or denomination,rights
" Under the Protection of Civil Rights Act (1955), the offences committed on the ground of untouchability are punishable either by imprisonment up to six months or by fine upto 500 or both",rights
 A person convicted of the offence of ‘untouchability’ is disqualified for election to the Parliament or state legislature,rights
" The act declares the following acts as offences: (a) preventing any person from entering any place of public worship or from worshipping therein; (b) justifying untouchability on traditional, religious, philosophical or other grounds; (c) denying access to any shop, hotel or places of public entertainment; (d) insulting a person belonging to scheduled caste on the ground of untouchability; (e) refusing to admit persons in hospitals, educational institutions or hostels established for public benefit; (f) preaching untouchability directly or indirectly; and (g) refusing to sell goods or render services to any person",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the right under Article 17 is available against private individuals and it is the constitutional obligation of the State to take necessary action to ensure that this right is not violated,rights
 These National Awards were instituted in 195 The Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai discontinued them in 197 But they were again revived in 1980 by the Indira Gandhi government,rights
 RIGHT TO FREEDOM  Protection of Six Rights Article 19 guarantees to all citizens the six rights,rights
 These are: (i) Right to freedom of speech and expression,rights
 (ii) Right to assemble peaceably and without arms,rights
 (iii) Right to form associations or unions or co-operative societies,rights
10 (iv) Right to move freely throughout the territory of India,rights
 (v) Right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India,rights
" (vi) Right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business",rights
" Originally, Article 19 contained seven rights",rights
" But, the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property was deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of 197 These six rights are protected against only state action and not private individuals",rights
" Moreover, these rights are available only to the citizens and to shareholders of a company but not to foreigners or legal persons like companies or corporations, etc",rights
 The State can impose ‘reasonable’ restrictions on the enjoyment of these six rights only on the grounds mentioned in the Article 19 itself and not on any other grounds,rights
" Freedom of Speech and Expression It implies that every citizen has the right to express his views, opinions, belief and convictions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picturing or in any other manner",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes the following: (a) Right to propagate one’s views as well as views of others,rights
 (b) Freedom of the press,rights
 (c) Freedom of commercial advertisements,rights
 (d) Right against tapping of telephonic conversation,rights
" (e) Right to telecast, that is, government has no monopoly on electronic media",rights
 (f) Right against bundh called by a political party or organisation,rights
 (g) Right to know about government activities,rights
 (h) Freedom of silence,rights
 (i) Right against imposition of pre-censorship on a newspaper,rights
 (j) Right to demonstration or picketing but not right to strike,rights
" The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the freedom of speech and expression on the grounds of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, and incitement to an offence",rights
 Freedom of Assembly Every citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms,rights
" It includes the right to hold public meetings, demonstrations and take out processions",rights
 This freedom can be exercised only on public land and the assembly must be peaceful and unarmed,rights
" This provision does not protect violent, disorderly, riotous assemblies, or one that causes breach of public peace or one that involves arms",rights
 This right does not include the right to strike,rights
" The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right of assembly on two grounds, namely, sovereignty and integrity of India and public order including the maintenance of traffic in the area concerned",rights
" Under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (1973), a magistrate can restrain an assembly, meeting or procession if there is a risk of obstruction, annoyance or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of the public tranquillity or a riot or any affray",rights
" Under Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code, as assembly of five or more persons becomes unlawful if the object is (a) to resist the execution of any law or legal process; (b) to forcibly occupy the property of some person; (c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass; (d) to force some person to do an illegal act; and (e) to threaten the government or its officials on exercising lawful powers",rights
 Freedom of Association All citizens have the right to form associations or unions or co-operative societies10b,rights
" It includes the right to form political parties, companies, partnership firms, societies, clubs, organisations, trade unions or any body of persons",rights
 It not only includes the right to start an association or union but also to continue with the association or union as such,rights
" Further, it covers the negative right of not to form or join an association or union",rights
" Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of this right by the State on the grounds of sovereignty and integrity of India, public order and morality",rights
" Subject to these restrictions, the citizens have complete liberty to form associations or unions for pursuing lawful objectives and purposes",rights
" However, the right to obtain recognition of the association is not a fundamental right",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the trade unions have no guaranteed right to effective bargaining or right to strike or right to declare a lock-out,rights
 The right to strike can be controlled by an appropriate industrial law,rights
 Freedom of Movement This freedom entitles every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of the country,rights
 He can move freely from one state to another or from one place to another within a state,rights
 This right underline the idea that India is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned,rights
" Thus, the purpose is to promote national feeling and not parochialism",rights
" The grounds of imposing reasonable restrictions on this freedom are two, namely, the interests of general public and the protection of interests of any scheduled tribe",rights
" The entry of outsiders in tribal areas is restricted to protect the distinctive culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes and to safeguard their traditional vocation and properties against exploitation",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the freedom of movement of prostitutes can be restricted on the ground of public health and in the interest of public morals,rights
 The Bombay High Court validated the restrictions on the movement of persons affected by AIDS,rights
" The freedom of movement has two dimensions, viz, internal (right to move inside the country) and external (right to move out of the country and right to come back to the country)",rights
 Freedom of Residence Every citizen has the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of the country,rights
" This right has two parts: (a) the right to reside in any part of the country, which means to stay at any place temporarily, and (b) the right to settle in any part of the country, which means to set up a home or domicile at any place permanently",rights
 This right is intended to remove internal barriers within the country or between any of its parts,rights
 This promotes nationalism and avoids narrow mindedness,rights
" The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right on two grounds, namely, the interest of general public and the protection of interests of any scheduled tribes",rights
" The right of outsiders to reside and settle in tribal areas is restricted to protect the distinctive culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes and to safeguard their traditional vocation and properties against exploitation",rights
" In many parts of the country, the tribals have been permitted to regulate their property rights in accordance with their customary rules and laws",rights
 The Supreme Court held that certain areas can be banned for certain kinds of persons like prostitutes and habitual offenders,rights
" From the above, it is clear that the right to residence and the right to movement are overlapping to some extent",rights
" All citizens are given the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business",rights
 This right is very wide as it covers all the means of earning one’s livelihood,rights
 The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right in the interest of the general public,rights
" Further, the State is empowered to: (a) prescribe professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business; and (b) carry on by itself any trade, business, industry or service whether to the exclusion (complete or partial) of citizens or otherwise",rights
" Thus, no objection can be made when the State carries on a trade, business, industry or service either as a monopoly (complete or partial) to the exclusion of citizens (all or some only) or in competition with any citizen",rights
 The State is not required to justify its monopoly,rights
" This right does not include the right to carry on a profession or business or trade or occupation that is immoral (trafficking in women or children) or dangerous (harmful drugs or explosives, etc,)",rights
 The State can absolutely prohibit these or regulate them through licencing,rights
"  Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences Article 20 grants protection against arbitrary and excessive punishment to an accused person, whether citizen or foreigner or legal person like a company or a corporation",rights
" It contains three provisions in that direction: (a) No ex-post-facto law: No person shall be (i) convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act, nor (ii) subjected to a penalty greater than that prescribed by the law in force at the time of the commission of the act",rights
 (b) No double jeopardy: No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once,rights
 (c) No self-incrimination: No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself,rights
" An ex-post-facto law is one that imposes penalties retrospectively (retroactively), that is, upon acts already done or which increases the penalties for such acts",rights
 The enactment of such a law is prohibited by the first provision of Article 20,rights
" However, this limitation is imposed only on criminal laws and not on civil laws or tax laws",rights
" In other words, a civil liability or a tax can be imposed retrospectively",rights
" Further, this provision prohibits only conviction or sentence under an ex-post-facto criminal law and not the trial thereof",rights
" Finally, the protection (immunity) under this provision cannot be claimed in case of preventive detention or demanding security from a person",rights
 The protection against double jeopardy is available only in proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal,rights
" In other words, it is not available in proceedings before departmental or administrative authorities as they are not of judicial nature",rights
 The protection against self-incrimination extends to both oral evidence and documentary evidence,rights
" However, it does not extend to (i) compulsory production of material objects, (ii) compulsion to give thumb impression, specimen signature, blood specimens, and (iii) compulsory exhibition of the body",rights
" Further, it extends only to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings or proceedings which are not of criminal nature",rights
  Protection of Life and Personal Liberty Article 21 declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law,rights
 This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens,rights
" In the famous Gopalan case11 (1950), the Supreme Court has taken a narrow interpretation of the Article 2 It held that the protection under Article 21 is available only against arbitrary executive action and not from arbitrary legislative action",rights
 This means that the State can deprive the right to life and personal liberty of a person based on a law,rights
" This is because of the expression ‘procedure established by law’ in Article 21, which is different from the expression ‘due process of law’ contained in the American Constitution",rights
" Hence, the validity of a law that has prescribed a procedure cannot be questioned on the ground that the law is unreasonable, unfair or unjust",rights
" Secondly, the Supreme Court held that the ‘personal liberty’ means only liberty relating to the person or body of the individual",rights
" But, in Menaka case12 (1978), the Supreme Court overruled its judgement in the Gopalan case by taking a wider interpretation of the Article 2 Therefore, it ruled that the right to life and personal liberty of a person can be deprived by a law provided the procedure prescribed by that law is reasonable, fair and just",rights
" In effect, the protection under Article 21 should be available not only against arbitrary executive action but also against arbitrary legislative action",rights
" Further, the court held that the ‘right to life’ as embodied in Article 21 is not merely confined to animal existence or survival but it includes within its ambit the right to live with human dignity and all those aspects of life which go to make a man’s life meaningful, complete and worth living",rights
 It also ruled that the expression ‘Personal Liberty’ in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights that go to constitute the personal liberties of a man,rights
 The Supreme Court has reaffirmed its judgement in the Menaka case in the subsequent cases,rights
 It has declared the following rights as part of Article 21: (1) Right to live with human dignity,rights
 (2) Right to decent environment including pollution free water and air and protection against hazardous industries,rights
 (3) Right to livelihood,rights
 (4) Right to privacy,rights
 (5) Right to shelter,rights
 (6) Right to health,rights
 (7) Right to free education up to 14 years of age,rights
 (8) Right to free legal aid,rights
 (9) Right against solitary confinement,rights
 (10) Right to speedy trial,rights
 (11) Right against handcuffing,rights
 (12) Right against inhuman treatment,rights
 (13) Right against delayed execution,rights
 (14) Right to travel abroad,rights
 (15) Right against bonded labour,rights
 (16) Right against custodial harassment,rights
 (17) Right to emergency medical aid,rights
 (18) Right to timely medical treatment in government hospital,rights
 (19) Right not to be driven out of a state,rights
 (20) Right to fair trial,rights
 (21) Right of prisoner to have necessities of life,rights
 (22) Right of women to be treated with decency and dignity,rights
 (23) Right against public hanging,rights
 (24) Right to hearing,rights
 (25) Right to information,rights
 (26) Right to reputation,rights
 (27) Right of appeal from a judgement of conviction (28) Right to social security and protection of the family (29) Right to social and economic justice and empowerment (30) Right against bar fetters (31) Right to appropriate life insurance policy (32) Right to sleep (33) Right to freedom from noise pollution (34) Right to electricity  Right to Education Article 21 A declares that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such a manner as the State may determine,rights
" Thus, this provision makes only elementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education",rights
 This provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 200 This amendment is a major milestone in the country’s aim to achieve ‘Education for All’,rights
 The government described this step as ‘the dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of citizens’ rights’,rights
" Even before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for free and compulsory education for children under Article 45 in Part IV",rights
 It now reads—‘The state shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years,rights
’ It also added a new fundamental duty under Article 51A that reads —‘It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen years’,rights
" In 1993 itself, the Supreme Court recognised a Fundamental Right to primary education in the right to life under Article 2 It held that every child or citizen of this country has a right to free education until he completes the age of 14 years",rights
" Thereafter, his right to education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the state",rights
" In this judgement, the Court overruled its earlier judgement (1992) which declared that there was a fundamental right to education up to any level including professional education like medicine and engineering",rights
" In pursuance of Article 21A, the Parliament enacted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 200 This Act seeks to provide that every child has a right to be provided full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards",rights
" This legislation is anchored in the belief that the values of equality, social justice and democracy and the creation of a just and humane society can be achieved only through provision of inclusive elementary education to all",rights
12a 5 Protection Against Arrest and Detention Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained,rights
" Detention is of two types, namely, punitive and preventive",rights
 Punitive detention is to punish a person for an offence committed by him after trial and conviction in a court,rights
" Preventive detention, on the other hand, means detention of a person without trial and conviction by a court",rights
 Its purpose is not to punish a person for a past offence but to prevent him from committing an offence in the near future,rights
" Thus, preventive detention is only a precautionary measure and based on suspicion",rights
 The Article 22 has two parts—the first part deals with the cases of ordinary law and the second part deals with the cases of preventive detention law,rights
 (a) The first part of Article 22 confers the following rights on a person who is arrested or detained under an ordinary law: (i) Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest,rights
 (ii) Right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner,rights
" (iii) Right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours, excluding the journey time",rights
 (iv) Right to be released after 24 hours unless the magistrate authorises further detention,rights
 These safeguards are not available to an enemy alien or a person arrested or detained under a preventive detention law,rights
" The Supreme Court also ruled that the arrest and detention in the first part of Article 22 do not cover arrest under the orders of a court, civil arrest, arrest on failure to pay the income tax, and deportation of an alien",rights
 They apply only to an act of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature or some activity prejudicial to public interest,rights
 (b) The second part of Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained under a preventive detention law,rights
 This protection is available to both citizens as well as aliens and includes the following: (i) The detention of a person cannot exceed three months unless an advisory board reports sufficient cause for extended detention,rights
 (ii) The grounds of detention should be communicated to the detenu,rights
" However, the facts considered to be against the public interest need not be disclosed",rights
 (iii) The detenu should be afforded an opportunity to make a representation against the detention order,rights
 Article 22 also authorises the Parliament to prescribe (a) the circumstances and the classes of cases in which a person can be detained for more than three months under a preventive detention law without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board; (b) the maximum period for which a person can be detained in any classes of cases under a preventive detention law; and (c) the procedure to be followed by an advisory board in an inquiry,rights
 The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 has reduced the period of detention without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board from three to two months,rights
" However, this provision has not yet been brought into force, hence, the original period of three months still continues",rights
 The Constitution has divided the legislative power with regard to preventive detention between the Parliament and the state legislatures,rights
" The Parliament has exclusive authority to make a law of preventive detention for reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs and the secu-rity of India",rights
" Both the Parliament as well as the state legislatures can concurrently make a law of preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a state, the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community",rights
" The preventive detention laws made by the Parliament are: (a) Preventive Detention Act, 1950",rights
" Expired in 196 (b) Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 197 Repealed in 197 (c) Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), 197 (d) National Security Act (NASA), 1980",rights
" (e) Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act (PBMSECA), 1980",rights
" (f) Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), 198 Repealed in 199 (g) Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (PITNDPSA), 198 (h) Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 200 Repealed in 200 It is unfortunate to know that no democratic country in the world has made preventive detention as an integral part of the Constitution as has been done in India",rights
 It was resorted to in Britain only during first and second world war time,rights
" In India, preventive detention existed even during the British rule",rights
" For example, the Bengal State Prisoners Regulation of 1818 and the Defence of India Act of 1939 provided for preventive detention",rights
" RIGHT AGAINST EXPLOITATION  Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings, begar (forced labour) and other similar forms of forced labour",rights
 Any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law,rights
 This right is available to both citizens and non-citizens,rights
 It protects the individual not only against the State but also against private persons,rights
" The expression ‘traffic in human beings’ include (a) selling and buying of men, women and children like goods; (b) immoral traffic in women and children, including prostitution; (c) devadasis; and (d) slavery",rights
" To punish these acts, the Parliament has made the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act13, 195 The term ‘begar’ means compulsory work without remuneration",rights
 It was a peculiar Indian system under which the local zamindars sometimes used to force their tenants to render services without any payment,rights
" In addition to begar, the Article 23 prohibits other ‘similar forms of forced labour’ like ‘bonded labour’",rights
 The term ‘forced labour’ means compelling a person to work against his will,rights
" The word ‘force’ includes not only physical or legal force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic circumstances, that is, working for less than the minimum wage",rights
" In this regard, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976; the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; the Contract Labour Act, 1970 and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 were made",rights
" It permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, as for example, military service or social service, for which it is not bound to pay",rights
" However, in imposing such service, the State is not permitted to make any discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class",rights
"  Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc",rights
" Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory, mine or other hazardous activities like construction work or railway",rights
 But it does not prohibit their employment in any harmless or innocent work,rights
" The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, is the most important law in this direction",rights
" In addition, the Employment of Children Act, 1938; the Factories Act, 1948; the Mines Act, 1952; the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958; the Plantation Labour Act, 1951; the Motor Transport Workers Act, 1951; Apprentices Act, 1961; the Bidi and Cigar Workers Act, 1966; and other similar acts prohibit the employment of children below certain age",rights
" In 1996, the Supreme Court directed the establishment of Child Labour Rehabilitation Welfare Fund in which the offending employer should deposit a fine of 20,000 for each child employed by him",rights
" It also issued directions for the improvement of education, health and nutrition of children",rights
" The Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a National Commission and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights and Children’s Courts for providing speedy trial of offences against children or of violation of child rights",rights
" In 2006, the government banned the employment of children as domestic servants or workers in business establishments like hotels, dhabas, restaurants, shops, factories, resorts, spas, tea-shops and so on",rights
 It warned that anyone employing children below 14 years of age would be liable for prosecution and penal action,rights
" Child Labour Amendment (2016) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, amended the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 198 It has renamed the Principal Act as the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 198 The Amendment Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and processes",rights
" Earlier, this prohibition was applicable to 18 occupations and 65 processes",rights
" Further, the Amendment Act prohibits the employment of adolescents (14 to 18 years of age) in certain hazardous occupations and processes",rights
 The Amendment Act also introduces more stringent punishment for the offenders,rights
" It is an imprisonment of 6 months to 2 years, or a fine of 20,000 to 50,000, or both",rights
" In case of repeated offences, the imprisonment is of 1 year to 3 years",rights
" RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION  Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion Article 25 says that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion",rights
 The implications of these are: (a) Freedom of conscience: Inner freedom of an individual to mould his relation with God or Creatures in whatever way he desires,rights
 (b) Right to profess: Declaration of one’s religious beliefs and faith openly and freely,rights
" (c) Right to practice: Performance of religious worship, rituals, ceremonies and exhibition of beliefs and ideas",rights
 (d) Right to propagate: Transmission and dissemination of one’s religious beliefs to others or exposition of the tenets of one’s religion,rights
" But, it does not include a right to convert another person to one’s own religion",rights
 Forcible conversions impinge on the ‘freedom of conscience’ guaranteed to all the persons alike,rights
" From the above, it is clear that Article 25 covers not only religious beliefs (doctrines) but also religious practices (rituals)",rights
" Moreover, these rights are available to all persons—citizens as well as non-citizens",rights
" However, these rights are subject to public order, morality, health and other provisions relating to fundamental rights",rights
" Further, the State is permitted to: (a) regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice; and (b) provide for social welfare and reform or throw open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus",rights
" Article 25 also contains two explanations: one, wearing and carrying of kirpans is to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion; and two, the Hindus, in this context, include Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists",rights
"14  Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs According to Article 26, every religious denomination or any of its section shall have the following rights: (a) Right to establish and maintain institu-tions for religious and charitable purposes; (b) Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; (c) Right to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and (d) Right to administer such property in accordance with law",rights
" Article 25 guarantees rights of individuals, while Article 26 guarantees rights of religious denominations or their sections",rights
" In other words, Article 26 protects collective freedom of religion",rights
" Like the rights under Article 25, the rights under Article 26 are also subject to public order, morality and health but not subject to other provisions relating to the Fundamental Rights",rights
 The Supreme Court held that a religious denomination must satisfy three conditions: (a) It should be a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs (doctrines) which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being; (b) It should have a common organisation; and (c) It should be designated by a distinctive name,rights
" Under the above criteria, the Supreme Court held that the ‘Ramakrishna Mission’ and ‘Ananda Marga’ are religious denominations within the Hindu religion",rights
 It also held that Aurobindo Society is not a religious denomination,rights
  Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion Article 27 lays down that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination,rights
" In other words, the State should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion",rights
" This provision prohibits the State from favouring, patronising and supporting one religion over the other",rights
 This means that the taxes can be used for the promotion or maintenance of all religions,rights
 This provision prohibits only levy of a tax and not a fee,rights
"  Freedom from Attending Religious Instruction Under Article 28, no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds",rights
" However, this provision shall not apply to an educational institution administered by the State but established under any endowment or trust, requiring imparting of religious instruction in such institution",rights
" Further, no person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to attend any religious instruction or worship in that institution without his consent",rights
" In case of a minor, the consent of his guardian is needed",rights
" CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS  Protection of Interests of Minorities Article 29 provides that any section of the citizens residing in any part of India having a distinct language, script or culture of its own, shall have the right to conserve the same",rights
" Further, no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, or language",rights
 The first provision protects the right of a group while the second provision guarantees the right of a citizen as an individual irrespective of the community to which he belongs,rights
 Article 29 grants protection to both religious minorities as well as linguistic minorities,rights
" However, the Supreme Court held that the scope of this article is not necessarily restricted to minorities only, as it is commonly assumed to be",rights
 This is because of the use of words ‘section of citizens’ in the Article that include minorities as well as majority,rights
 The Supreme Court also held that the right to conserve the language includes the right to agitate for the protection of the language,rights
" Hence, the political speeches or promises made for the conservation of the language of a section of the citizens does not amount to corrupt practice under the Representation of the People Act, 195  Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions Article 30 grants the following rights to minorities, whether religious or linguistic: (a) All minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice",rights
 (b) The compensation amount fixed by the State for the compulsory acquisition of any property of a minority educational institution shall not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed to them,rights
 This provision was added by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 to protect the right of minorities in this regard,rights
 The Act deleted the right to property as a Fundamental Right (Article 31),rights
" (c) In granting aid, the State shall not discriminate against any educational institution managed by a minority",rights
" Thus, the protection under Article 30 is confined only to minorities (religious or linguistic) and does not extend to any section of citizens (as under Article 29)",rights
" However, the term ‘minority’ has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution",rights
 The right under Article 30 also includes the right of a minority to impart education to its children in its own language,rights
" The institutions of third type are free to administer their affairs but subject to operation of general laws like contract law, labour law, industrial law, tax law, economic regulations, and so on",rights
" In a judgement delivered in the Secretary of Malankara Syrian Catholic College case14a (2007), the Supreme Court has summarized the general principles relating to establishment and administration of minority educational institutions in the following way :  The right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice comprises the following rights : (i) To choose its governing body in whom the founders of the institution have faith and confidence to conduct and manage the affairs of the institution; (ii) To appoint teaching staff (teachers/lecturers and headmasters/ principals) as also non-teaching staff; and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its employees; (iii) To admit eligible students of their choice and to set up a reasonable fee structure; and (iv) To use its properties and assets for the benefit of the institution",rights
  The right conferred on minorities under Article 30 is only to ensure equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a more advantageous position vis-à-vis the majority,rights
 There is no reverse discrimination in favour of minorities,rights
  The right to establish and administer educational institutions is not absolute,rights
 Nor does it include the right to maladminister,rights
 There can be regulatory measures for ensuring educational character and standards and maintaining academic excellence,rights
" There can be checks on administration as are necessary to ensure that the administration is efficient and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the institution",rights
" Regulations made by the State concerning generally the welfare of students and teachers, regulations laying down eligibility criteria and qualifications for appointment, as also conditions of service of employees (both teaching and non-teaching), regulations to prevent exploitation or oppression of employees, and regulations prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study fall under this category",rights
 Such regulations do not in any manner interfere with the right under Article 30(1),rights
"  Subject to the eligibility conditions/qualifications prescribed by the State being met, the unaided minority educational institutions will have the freedom to appoint teachers/lecturers by adopting any rational procedure of selection",rights
"  Extention of aid by the State, does not alter the nature and character of the minority educational institutions",rights
" The conditions can be imposed by the State to ensure proper utilization of the aid, without however diluting or abridging the right under Article 30(1)",rights
" RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES A mere declaration of fundamental rights in the Constitution is meaningless, useless and worthless without providing an effective machinery for their enforcement, if and when they are violated",rights
" Hence, Article 32 confers the right to remedies for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen",rights
" In other words, the right to get the Fundamental Rights protected is in itself a fundamental right",rights
 This makes the fundamental rights real,rights
 That is why Dr Ambedkar called Article 32 as the most important article of the Constitution—‘an Article without which this constitution would be a nullity,rights
 It is the very soul of the Constitution and the very heart of it’,rights
 The Supreme Court has ruled that Article 32 is a basic feature of the Constitution,rights
" Hence, it cannot be abridged or taken away even by way of an amendment to the Constitution",rights
 It contains the following four provisions: (a) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights is guaranteed,rights
 (b) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights,rights
" The writs issued may includehabeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quowarranto",rights
" (c) Parliament can empower any other court to issue directions, orders and writs of all kinds",rights
" However, this can be done without prejudice to the above powers conferred on the Supreme Court",rights
 Any other court here does not include high courts because Article 226 has already conferred these powers on the high courts,rights
 (d) The right to move the Supreme Court shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by the Constitution,rights
 Thus the Constitution provides that the President can suspend the right to move any court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights during a national emergency (Article 359),rights
 It is thus clear that the Supreme Court has been constituted as the defender and guarantor of the fundamenetal rights of the citizens,rights
 It has been vested with the ‘original’ and ‘wide’ powers for that purpose,rights
" Original, because an aggrieved citizen can directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal",rights
" Wide, because its power is not restricted to issuing of orders or directions but also writs of all kinds",rights
" The purpose of Article 32 is to provide a guaranteed, effective, expedious, inexpensive and summary remedy for the protection of the fundamental rights",rights
" Only the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution can be enforced under Article 32 and not any other right like non-fundamental constitutional rights, statutory rights, customary rights and so on",rights
" The violation of a fundamental right is the sine qua non for the exercise of the right conferred by Article 3 In other words, the Supreme Court, under Article 32, cannot determine a question that does not involve Fundamental Rights",rights
 Article 32 cannot be invoked simply to determine the constitutionality of an executive order or a legislation unless it directly infringes any of the fundamental rights,rights
" In case of the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original but not exclusive",rights
" It is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the high court under Article 22 It vests original powers in the high court to issue directions, orders and writs of all kinds for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights",rights
" It means when the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court or the Supreme Court directly",rights
" Since the right guaranteed by Article 32 (ie, the right to move the Supreme Court where a fundamental right is infringed) is in itself a fundamental right, the availability of alternate remedy is no bar to relief under Article 3 However, the Supreme Court has ruled that where relief through high court is available under Article 226, the aggrieved party should first move the high court",rights
" WRITS—TYPES AND SCOPE The Supreme Court (under Article 32) and the high courts (under Article 226) can issue the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo-warranto",rights
" Further, the Parliament (under Article 32) can empower any other court to issue these writs",rights
" Since no such provision has been made so far, only the Supreme Court and the high courts can issue the writs and not any other court",rights
" Before 1950, only the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras had the power to issue the writs",rights
 Article 226 now empowers all the high courts to issue the writs,rights
 These writs are borrowed from English law where they are known as ‘prerogative writs’,rights
" They are so called in England as they were issued in the exercise of the prerogative of the King who was, and is still, described as the ‘fountain of justice’",rights
" Later, the high court started issuing these writs as extraordinary remedies to uphold the rights and liberties of the British people",rights
 The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court differs from that of a high court in three respects:  The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights whereas a high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for any other purpose,rights
 The expression ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an ordinary legal right,rights
" Thus, the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in this respect, is narrower than that of high court",rights
  The Supreme Court can issue writs against a person or government throughout the territory of India whereas a high court can issue writs against a person residing or against a government or authority located within its territorial jurisdiction only or outside its territorial jurisdiction only if the cause of action arises within its territorial jurisdiction,rights
"15 Thus, the territorial jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the purpose of issuing writs is wider than that of a high court",rights
"  A remedy under Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and hence, the Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction",rights
" On the other hand, a remedy under Article 226 is discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction",rights
 Article 32 does not merely confer power on the Supreme Court as Article 226 does on a high court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights or other rights as part of its general jurisdiction,rights
 The Supreme Court is thus constituted as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights,rights
" Now, we will proceed to understand the meaning and scope of different kinds of writs mentioned in Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution: Habeas Corpus It is a Latin term which literally means ‘to have the body of’",rights
" It is an order issued by the court to a person who has detained another person, to produce the body of the latter before it",rights
 The court then examines the cause and legality of detention,rights
" It would set the detained person free, if the detention is found to be illegal",rights
" Thus, this writ is a bulwark of individual liberty against arbitrary detention",rights
 The writ of habeas corpus can be issued against both public authorities as well as private individuals,rights
" The writ, on the other hand, is not issued where the (a) detention is lawful, (b) the proceeding is for contempt of a legislature or a court, (c) detention is by a competent court, and (d) detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court",rights
 Mandamus It literally means ‘we command’,rights
 It is a command issued by the court to a public official asking him to perform his official duties that he has failed or refused to perform,rights
" It can also be issued against any public body, a corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal or government for the same purpose",rights
 The writ of mandamus cannot be issued (a) against a private individual or body; (b) to enforce departmental instruction that does not possess statutory force; (c) when the duty is discretionary and not mandatory; (d) to enforce a contractual obligation; (e) against the president of India or the state governors; and (f) against the chief justice of a high court acting in judicial capacity,rights
" Prohibition Literally, it means ‘to forbid’",rights
 It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a jurisdiction that it does not possess,rights
" Thus, unlike mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity",rights
 The writ of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and quasijudicial authorities,rights
" It is not available against administrative authorities, legislative bodies, and private individuals or bodies",rights
" Certiorari In the literal sense, it means ‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’",rights
 It is issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a case,rights
 It is issued on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or error of law,rights
" Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is both preventive as well as curative",rights
" Previously, the writ of certiorari could be issued only against judicial and quasi-judicial authorities and not against administrative authories",rights
" However, in 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that the certiorari can be issued even against administrative authorities affecting rights of individuals",rights
" Like prohibition, certiorari is also not available against legislative bodies and private individuals or bodies",rights
" Quo-Warranto In the literal sense, it means ‘by what authority or warrant’",rights
 It is issued by the court to enquire into the legality of claim of a person to a public office,rights
" Hence, it prevents illegal usurpation of public office by a person",rights
 The writ can be issued only in case of a substantive public office of a permanent character created by a statute or by the Constitution,rights
 It cannot be issued in cases of ministerial office or private office,rights
" Unlike the other four writs, this can be sought by any interested person and not necessarily by the aggrieved person",rights
" ARMED FORCES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 33 empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the fundamental rights of the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police forces, intelligence agencies and analogous forces",rights
 The objective of this provision is to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them,rights
 The power to make laws under Article 33 is conferred only on Parliament and not on state legislatures,rights
 Any such law made by Parliament cannot be challenged in any court on the ground of contravention of any of the fundamental rights,rights
" Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the Army Act (1950), the Navy Act (1950), the Air Force Act (1950), the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966, the Border Security Force Act and so on",rights
" These impose restrictions on their freedom of speech, right to form associations, right to be members of trade unions or political associations, right to communicate with the press, right to attend public meetings or demonstrations, etc",rights
" The expression‘members of the armed forces’ also covers such employees of the armed forces as barbers, carpenters, mechanics, cooks, chowkidars, bootmakers, tailors who are non-combatants",rights
" A parliamentary law enacted under Article 33 can also exclude the court martials (tribunals established under the military law) from the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the high courts, so far as the enforcement of Fundamental Rights is concerned",rights
 Table 3 Martial Law Vs National Emergency Martial Law National Emergency  It affects only Fundamental Rights,rights
"  It affects not only Fundamental Rights but also Centre–state relations, distribution of revenues and legislative powers between centre and states and may extend the tenure of the Parliament",rights
 MARTIAL LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 34 provides for the restrictions on fundamental rights while martial law is in force in any area within the territory of India,rights
 It empowers the Parliament to indemnify any government servant or any other person for any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area where martial law was in force,rights
" The Parliament can also validate any sentence passed, punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered or other act done under martial law in such area",rights
 The Act of Indemnity made by the Parliament cannot be challenged in any court on the ground of contravention of any of the fundamental rights,rights
 The concept of martial law has been borrowed in India from the English common law,rights
" However, the expression ‘martial law’ has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution",rights
 It refers to a situation where civil administration is run by the military authorities according to their own rules and regulations framed outside the ordinary law,rights
 It thus imply the suspension of ordinary law and the government by military tribunals,rights
 It is different from the military law that is applicable to the armed forces,rights
 There is also no specific or express provision in the Constitution that authorises the executive to declare martial law,rights
" However, it is implicit in Article 34 under which martial law can be declared in any area within the territory of India",rights
" The martial law is imposed under the extraordinary circumstances like war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion, riot or any violent resistance to law",rights
 Its justification is to repel force by force for maintaining or restoring order in the society,rights
" During the operation of martial law, the military authorities are vested with abnormal powers to take all necessary steps",rights
" They impose restrictions and regulations on the rights of the civilians, can punish the civilians and even condemn them to death",rights
 The Supreme Court held that the declaration of martial law does not ipso facto result in the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,rights
" The declaration of a martial law under Article 34 is different from the declaration of a national emergency under Article 35 The differences between the two are summarised in Table  EFFECTING CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS Article 35 lays down that the power to make laws, to give effect to certain specified fundamental rights shall vest only in the Parliament and not in the state legislatures",rights
 This provision ensures that there is uniformity throughout India with regard to the nature of those fundamental rights and punishment for their infringement,rights
" In this direction, Article 35 contains the following provisions:  The Parliament shall have (and the legislature of a state shall not have) power to make laws with respect to the following matters: (a) Prescribing residence as a condition for certain employments or appointments in a state or union territory or local authority or other authority (Article 16)",rights
" (b) Empowering courts other than the Supreme Court and the high courts to issue directions, orders and writs of all kinds for the enforcement of fundamental rights (Article 32)",rights
" (c) Restricting or abrogating the application of Fundamental Rights to members of armed forces, police forces, etc",rights
 (d) Indemnifying any government servant or any other person for any act done during the operation of martial law in any area (Article 34),rights
  Parliament shall have (and the legislature of a state shall not have) powers to make laws for prescribing punishment for those acts that are declared to be offences under the fundamental rights,rights
 These include the following: (a) Untouchability (Article 17),rights
 (b) Traffic in human beings and forced labour (Article 23),rights
" Further, the Parliament shall, after the commencement of the Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the above acts, thus making it obligatory on the part of the Parliament to enact such laws",rights
  Any law in force at the commencement of the Constitution with respect to any of the matters specified above is to continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by the Parliament,rights
" It should be noted that Article 35 extends the competence of the Parliament to make a law on the matters specified above, even though some of those matters may fall within the sphere of the state legislatures ( State List)",rights
" PRESENT POSITION OF RIGHT TO PROPERTY Originally, the right to property was one of the seven fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution",rights
" It was dealt by Article 19(1)(f) and Article 3 Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property",rights
" Article 31, on the other hand, guaranteed to every person, whether citizen or non-citizen, right against deprivation of his property",rights
 It provided that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law,rights
" It empowered the State to acquire or requisition the property of a person on two conditions: (a) it should be for public purpose, and (b) it should provide for payment of compensation (amount) to the owner",rights
" Since the commencement of the Constitution, the Fundamental Right to Property has been the most controversial",rights
 Most of the litigation centred around the obligation of the state to pay compensation for acquisition or requisition of private property,rights
" Therefore, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to property as a Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 from Part III",rights
" Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII under the heading ‘Right to Property’",rights
 It provides that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law,rights
" Thus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional right, though no longer a fundamental right",rights
 It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution,rights
" The right to property as a legal right (as distinct from the Fundamental Rights) has the following implications: (a) It can be regulated ie, curtailed, abridged or modified without constitutional amend-ment by an ordinary law of the Parliament",rights
 (b) It protects private property against executive action but not against legislative action,rights
" (c) In case of violation, the aggrieved person cannot directly move the Supreme Court under Article 32 (right to constitutional remedies including writs) for its enforcement",rights
 He can move the High Court under Article 22 (d) No guaranteed right to compensation in case of acquisition or requisition of the private property by the state,rights
" Though the Fundamental Right to Property under Part III has been abolished, the Part III still carries two provisions which provide for the guaranteed right to compensation in case of acquisition or requisition of the private property by the state",rights
 These two cases where compensation has to be paid are: (a) When the State acquires the property of a minority educational institution (Article 30); and (b) When the State acquires the land held by a person under his personal cultivation and the land is within the statutory ceiling limits (Article 31 A),rights
" The first provision was added by the 44th Amendment Act (1978), while the second provision was added by the 17th Amendment Act (1964)",rights
" Further, Articles 31A, 31B and 31C have been retained as exceptions to the fundamental rights",rights
" EXCEPTIONS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS  Saving of Laws Providing for Acquisition of Estates, etc",rights
" Article 31A16 saves five categories of laws from being challenged and invalidated on the ground of contravention of the fundamental rights conferred by Article 14 (equality before law and equal protection of laws) and Article 19 (protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly, movement, etc",rights
" They are related to agricultural land reforms, industry and commerce and include the following: (a) Acquisition of estates17 and related rights by the State; (b) Taking over the management of properties by the State; (c) Amalgamation of corporations; (d) Extinguishment or modification of rights of directors or shareholders of corporations; and (e) Extinguishment or modification of mining leases",rights
 Article 31A does not immunise a state law from judicial review unless it has been reserved for the president’s consideration and has received his assent,rights
 This Article also provides for the payment of compensation at market value when the state acquires the land held by a person under his personal cultivation and the land is within the statutory ceiling limit,rights
 Article 31B immunises any law included in the Ninth Schedule from all the fundamental rights whether or not the law falls under any of the five categories specified in Article 31A,rights
" Coelho case18a (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule",rights
 The court held that judicial review is a ‘basic feature’ of the constitution and it could not be taken away by putting a law under the Ninth Schedule,rights
" It said that the laws placed under the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are open to challenge in court if they violated fundamentals rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 or the ‘basic structure’ of the constitution",rights
" It was on April 24, 1973, that the Supreme Court first propounded the doctrine of ‘basic structure’ or ‘basic features’ of the constitution in its landmark verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati Case",rights
"19 Originally (in 1951), the Ninth Schedule contained only 13 acts and regulations but at present (in 2016) their number is 2820 Of these, the acts and regulations of the state legislature deal with land reforms and abolition of the zamindari system and that of the Parliament deal with other matters",rights
"  Saving of Laws Giving Effect to Certain Directive Principles Article 31C, as inserted by the 25th Amendment Act of 1971, contained the following two provisions: (a) No law that seeks to implement the socialistic directive principles specified in Article 39(b)21 or (c)22 shall be void on the ground of contravention of the fundamental rights conferred by Article 14 (equality before law and equal protection of laws) or Article 19 (protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly, movement, etc",rights
) (b) No law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be questioned in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such a policy,rights
" In the Kesavananda Bharati case23 (1973), the Supreme Court declared the above second provision of Article 31C as unconstitutional and invalid on the ground that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and hence, cannot be taken away",rights
 The 42nd Amendment Act (1976) extended the scope of the above first provision of Article 31C by including within its protection any law to implement any of the directive principles specified in Part IV of the Constitution and not merely in Article 39 (b) or (c),rights
 CRITICISM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS The Fundamental Rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution have met with a wide and varied criticism,rights
" The arguments of the critics are:  Excessive Limitations They are subjected to innumerable exceptions, restrictions, qualifications and explanations",rights
" Hence, the critics remarked that the Constitution grants Fundamental Rights with one hand and takes them away with the other",rights
 Jaspat Roy Kapoor went to the extent of saying that the chapter dealing with the fundamental rights should be renamed as ‘Limitaions on Fundamental Rights’ or ‘Fundamental Rights and Limitations Thereon’,rights
  No Social and Economic Rights The list is not comprehensive as it mainly consists of political rights,rights
" It makes no provision for important social and economic rights like right to social security, right to work, right to employment, right to rest and leisure and so on",rights
 These rights are made available to the citizens of advanced democratic countries,rights
" Also, the socialistic constitutions of erstwhile USSR or China provided for such rights",rights
  Preventive Detention The critics assert that the provision for preventive detention (Article 22) takes away the spirit and substance of the chapter on fundamental rights,rights
 It confers arbitrary powers on the State and negates individual liberty,rights
 It justifies the criticism that the Constitution of India deals more with the rights of the State against the individual than with the rights of the individual against the State,rights
" Notably, no democratic country in the world has made preventive detention as an integral part of their Constitutions as has been made in India",rights
"  No Consistent Philosophy According to some critics, the chapter on fundamental rights is not the product of any philosophical principle",rights
 Sir Ivor Jennings expressed this view when he said that the Fundamental Rights proclaimed by the Indian Constitution are based on no consistent philosophy,rights
25 The critics say that this creates difficulty for the Supreme Court and the high courts in interpreting the fundamental rights,rights
" RIGHTS OUTSIDE PART III Besides the Fundamental Rights included in Part III, there are certain other rights contained in other parts of the Constitution",rights
 These rights are known as constitutional rights or legal rights or non-fundamental rights,rights
 They are:  No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law (Article 265 in Part XII),rights
  No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law (Article 300-A in Part XII),rights
"  Trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free (Article 301 in Part XIII)",rights
  The elections to the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assembly shall be on the basis of adult suffrage (Article 326 in Part XV),rights
" Even though the above rights are also equally justiciable, they are different from the Fundamental Rights",rights
" In case of violation of a Fundamental Right, the aggrieved person can directly move the Supreme Court for its enforcement under Article 32, which is in itself a fundamental right",rights
" But, in case of violation of the above rights, the aggrieved person cannot avail this constitutional remedy",rights
 He can move the High Court by an ordinary suit or under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction of high court),rights
